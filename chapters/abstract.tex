The BeachBot is a mobile, autonomous drawing robot for large scale sand art. Its primary purpose is the entertainment of beachgoers. The goal of this thesis is to develop and evaluate algorithms to automatically generate suitable trajectories to draw arbitrary images on the canvas. Main challenges have been to find a trajectory that reduces the drawing time and to make watching the drawing process appealing. A state-of-the-art traveling salesman problem solver is adapted and used to find an approximately optimal solution, and spiro splines for designing transition trajectories with $G^2$-continuity and limited curvature. Two algorithms for filling arbitrary shapes are presented: A Spiral fill and a Zig Zag fill.
