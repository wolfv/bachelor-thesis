The BeachBot is a mobile, autonomous drawing robot for large scale sand art. Its primary purpose is the entertainment of beachgoers. The goal of this thesis was to develop and evaluate algorithms to automatically generate suitable trajectories to draw arbitrary images on the canvas. Main challenges have been to find a trajectory that reduces the drawing time and to make watching the drawing process appealing.
