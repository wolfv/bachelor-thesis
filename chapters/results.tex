\chapter{Results}

In this chapter, the results of the previously described algorithms will be discussed. Generally, all black lines are drawn with the rake down, and the red lines are the connection paths where the BeachBot is driving with the rake in upper position.

\section{Verifying LKH Solutions}

To verify that the LK heuristic produces viable output and that the tour postprocessing works, two simple test images are presented:

\begin{figure}
\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

\caption{The red arrows show the tour: The nearest neighbour is not chosen and a more global optimum is obtained.}
\end{subfigure}
~
\begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

\caption{Again, not the nearest vertex on the polygon is chosen but rather a vertex where the global tour distance is minimized.}
\end{subfigure}

\end{figure}

\section{Line Drawings}

Line drawings consist of no filled areas. These types of drawings are easily created manually and therefore we have used them extensively during testing. The solutions of the manual drawings (with manual connections) are now compared to the solutions generated by the algorithm.

\subsection{The Lion Drawing}

The lion was one of the earliest drawings that the BeachBot was able to reproduce on the beach canvas. It is also available as part of the distributed source of the application (\texttt{assets/lion\_example.svg}).

\subsection{The Shark Drawing}

Another line drawing, with a closed polygon, is the \enquote{Danger, Sharks} drawing.
