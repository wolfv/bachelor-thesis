\chapter{Results}

In this chapter, the results of the previously described algorithms will be discussed. Generally, all black lines are drawn with the rake down, and the red lines are the connection paths where the BeachBot is driving with the rake in upper position. The post processing is \textit{not} applied in these images.

\section{Verifying LKH Solutions}

To verify that the TSP solver produces viable output and that the tour postprocessing works, two simple test images are presented in \autoref{fig:ver_tsp}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{The red arrows show the tour: The nearest neighbour is not chosen and a more global optimum is obtained.}

\section{Line Drawings}

Line drawings consist of no filled areas. This type of drawing is easily created manually and therefore we have used them extensively during testing. The solutions of the manual drawings (with manual connections) are compared to the solutions generated by the algorithm.

\subsection{The Lion Drawing}

The lion was one of the earliest drawings that the BeachBot was able to reproduce on the beach canvas. It is also available as part of the distributed source of the application (\texttt{assets/lion\_example.svg}).

\end{subfigure}

\subsection{The Shark Drawing}

Another line drawing, with a closed polygon, is the \enquote{Danger, Sharks} drawing.

\end{subfigure}

\end{subfigure}

\subsection{Fonts}

\textit{Inkscape} has an extension called Hershey Text\footnote{\url{http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2011/hershey-text-an-inkscape-extension-for-engraving-fonts/}}, which offers a variety of engraving fonts that have been designed by Hershey in 1967 \cite{hershey1967calligraphy}. While designed for the purpose of being engraved to metal or stone, they are equally well suited to be drawn on sand. There are variants of each font, from single line to three lines per letter. As of now, only the single line variant has been tested with the path generator. For the single line variant two different styles are available: script and sans-serif.
