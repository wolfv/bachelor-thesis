\chapter{Results}

In this chapter, the results of the previously described algorithms will be discussed. Generally, all black lines are drawn with the rake down, and the red lines are the connection paths where the BeachBot is driving with the rake in upper position. The post processing is \textit{not} applied in these images.

\section{Verifying LKH Solutions}

To verify that the TSP solver produces viable output and that the tour postprocessing works, two simple test images are presented in \autoref{fig:ver_tsp}.

\section{Line Drawings}

Line drawings consist of no filled areas. This type of drawing is easily created manually and therefore we have used them extensively during testing. The solutions of the manual drawings (with manual connections) are compared to the solutions generated by the algorithm.

\subsection{The Lion Drawing}

The lion was one of the earliest (manual) drawings that the BeachBot was able to reproduce on the beach canvas. The generated path resembles the manual drawing very closely. Adding two enforced connections forces the TSP to take the same route than the manual drawing.

Note that the outer roundings visible at the feets and the mane are created by the spiro connection: the paths are cut at these points.

\subsection{The Shark Drawing}
Another line drawing, with a closed polygon, is the \enquote{Danger, Sharks} drawing. The drawing had to be slightly adapted due to some advanced SVG features used in the original image. Therefore, one wave is missing, which could have easily been added. The triangular polygon surrounds the other drawing elements. In  the second image it is shown how the TSP modification described in \autoref{sec:cont} reacts.

\subsection{Fonts}

\textit{Inkscape} has an extension called Hershey Text\footnote{\url{http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2011/hershey-text-an-inkscape-extension-for-engraving-fonts/}}, which offers a variety of engraving fonts that have been designed by Hershey in 1967 \cite{hershey1967calligraphy}. While designed for the purpose of being engraved to metal or stone, they are equally well suited to be drawn on sand. There are variants of each font, from single line to three lines per letter. As of now, only the single line variant has been tested with the path generator. For the single line variant two different styles are available: script and sans-serif.

\section{Drawings with Filled Areas}
\subsection{ASL Logo}

Various spiral fills are demonstrated on the ASL logo and a typesetted ASL lettering. It is clearly visible that the spiral filling works well for convex shapes.

\end{subfigure}

\subsection{The GNU Logo}

As case study, the \textit{GNU} Logo is presented. The emblematic gnu head is further simplified by manually tracing the outlines and removing superflous details with which the BeachBot would have difficulties to reproduce. With the simplified image as input, the path generator first generates a fill for the horns and the beard and then connects all elements by support trajectories.
